1 linenote User Manual
**************************

linenote is the package inspired by Visual Studio Code extension,
Linenote
(<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tkrkt.linenote>),
providing functions to notes on source code.

   This manual is for linenote version 1.1.3.

2 What is this package?
***********************

linenote has several key features:

   • Creating a note and tags per line
   • Saving notes by preserving the directory structure
   • Compatibility with VS Code Linenote extension
   • No org properties required
   • Based on a Git repository

   linenote is useful when you need a detailed note on a specific
line of code or document, unlike other note-taking packages that create
a note per file.  Additionally, the package does not require Org
properties but only utilizes the line number from the filename.

   Also, the package provides compatibility with the VS Code Linenote
extension.  If you manage the notes within the markdown (.md) format,
the same notes can also be utilized in Visual Studio Code.

   These features make linenote useful when you need ‘line-by-line’
notes to analyze the code and share notes with others.  I use this
package for analyzing Linux kernel and sharing insights with people
(most of them are vscode users).

3.1 Creating notes
==================

The command ‘linenote-add-annodate’ and ‘linenote-edit-annotate’
creates a note for the current line.  If you select multiple lines, then
the note for the selected lines will be created.  The created note is
located at ‘$PROJECT/.linenote/$RELATIVE_PATH’ directory.  For instance,
if the relative path of the current buffer is
‘arch/arm64/kernel/head.S’, then a note for the line #256 will be saved
as ‘.linenote/arch/arm64/kernel/head.S#L256.md’ or
‘.linenote/arch/arm64/kernel/head.S#L256.org’.

  1. Open a file and move cursor to where you want to add a note.
  2. ‘M-x linenote-add-annotate’.
  3. A new note will be created.

3.2 Removing notes
==================

To remove notes, move the cursor on the target line and do ‘M-x
linenote-remove-annotate’.  You can also remove the note directly
from the path ‘$PROJECT/.linenote’.

3.3 Adding tags
===============

The command ‘linenote-add-tags’ inserts tags for the current line.
Note that it won't be allowed if the corresponding note does not exist
for the current line.  You can add multiple tags separated by ',', for
example, ‘tag_1,tag_2’.  The tags will be shown when you are browsing
notes with ‘linenote-browse’.
