;;; Setup:

;; (require 'linenote)

;;; Commentary:

;; This package makes it possible to attach notes to specific lines in
;; source code files.  The notes are stored in separate files and are
;; displayed when point is on a line to which a note is attached.

;; To activate the mode in a buffer, use `M-x linenote-mode`.  Then, the
;; following commands are available, which can be freely bound to keys:

;; - linenote-next-note
;; - linenote-previous-note
;; - linenote-create/open-note
;; - linenote-remove-note
;; - linenote-open-root-dir
;; - linenote-open-note-dir

;; Notes are stored in a subdirectory of the project directory, by default
;; named `.linenote`.

;; TODO
;;
;; - Properly deal with directories that are not part of a project: Should
;;   they be excluded altogether, or should there be some fallback
;;   behaviour?
;;
;; - What happens when the user wants to create a new note in a region that
;;   already has a note attached to it?
;;
;; - Consider the following pattern:
;;
;;         (if-let* ((note (linenote--note-at-line))
;;                   (note-path (linenote--create-note-path)))
;;           ...)
;;
;;   This occurs a few times and is actually not very pretty, because
;;   `linenote--create-note-path' calls `linenote--note-at-line'
;;   itself.  I'm not sure there's an elegant way to fix this, though.
