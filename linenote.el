;;; Setup:

;; (require 'linenote)

;;; Commentary:

;; This package makes it possible to attach notes to specific lines in
;; source code files.  The notes are stored in separate files and are
;; displayed when point is on a line to which a note is attached.

;; To activate the mode in a buffer, use `M-x linenote-mode`.  Then, the
;; following commands are available, which can be freely bound to keys:

;; - `linenote-next-note'
;; - `linenote-previous-note'
;; - `linenote-create/open-note'
;; - `linenote-remove-note'
;; - `linenote-open-root-dir'
;; - `linenote-open-note-dir'
;; - `linenote-add-tags'
;; - `linenote-remove-tags'

;; There is also a transient that can be bound to a key: `linenote-transient'.

;; Notes are stored in a subdirectory of the project directory, by default
;; named `.linenote`.

;; TODO
;;
;; - Properly deal with directories that are not part of a project: Should
;;   they be excluded altogether, or should there be some fallback
;;   behaviour?
;;
;; - Consider the following pattern:
;;
;;         (if-let* ((note (linenote--note-at-line))
;;                   (note-path (linenote--create-note-path)))
;;           ...)
;;
;;   This occurs a few times and is actually not very pretty, because
;;   `linenote--create-note-path' calls `linenote--note-at-line'
;;   itself.  I'm not sure there's an elegant way to fix this, though.
